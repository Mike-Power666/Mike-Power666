- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mike-Power666.
- 👀 I’m interested in theoretical and computational magnetohydrodynamics and plasma physics, typically with an astrophysical application.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm learning more advanced shell scripting and software for intuitively building large code bases and making them more accessible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on current problems in star formation.
